Welcome to NLP Kaggle competition!

I'll walk you through this new competition: Feedback Prize - Predicting Effective Arguments

In this competition, we are given a dataset that contains argumentative essays written by U.S students in grades 6-12. As we will see, these essays were annotated by expert raters for discourse elements commonly found in argumentative writing. We are tasked to predict the effectiveness of these discourse elements in the essays. The goal is that such a predictive model can provide automated feedback to students to help them become more confident, proficient writers.

Let's get started with a detailed EDA:
